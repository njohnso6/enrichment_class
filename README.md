To use in codespaces, hover over the green code tab, select 'codespaces' and activate. Once everything installs and loads (could be some time, perhaps 10 minutes), to use RStudio Server go to the ports tab in VScode. Hover over the Forwarded Address column in the 8787 row and click the globe. The username and password are both "rstudio".

To pull up the R notebook, go to File>Open File and input /workspaces/enrichment_class/enrichment_cluster_profiler.Rmd

Then you'll be ready to start!
